<p>The National Center for Spectator Sports Safety and Security (NCS⁴) at the University of Southern Mississippi recognizes the inherent need for providing effective safety and security measures for sports and special events of all sizes. To promote a consistent methodology for risk management and security planning, the Center hosts annual summits for Intercollegiate Athletics, Interscholastic Athletics and After-School Activities, Commercial Sport and Entertainment Facilities, and Marathons and Running Events.</p>
<p>During these summits, representatives from event management, facilities operations, law enforcement, emergency management, fire, emergency medical services, technology firms, and public safety agencies discuss current safety and security issues, identify solutions, and propose future best practices through professional collaboration. The summits are an invaluable opportunity to discuss common challenges with other professionals, share lessons learned, and find innovative solutions to help improve your current safety and security operations. Panel discussions on trending issues and case study presentations focusing on recent incidents also provide valuable insight on the continued growth and evolution of venue and event protection.</p>
<p>Discussions with security experts during the summits, along with supplemental academic research, contribute to the development of safety and security best practice guidebooks. These guidebooks are available – for free download – to assist those responsible for safety and security at sports and special events.
