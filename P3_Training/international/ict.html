  <p><strong><em>The terrorist attacks on the night of 13 November 2015 at the Stade de France and the Bataclan Theater on in France showed that even small terror cells and “lone wolfs” can strike major national and international sporting and entertainment events. Beginning with the attacks on the Athlete’s Village at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany through today, terrorists are evolving their methods and tactics to strike large crowds of spectators and gain an audience for their organizations and ideology. Countries that host large spectator sports and entertainment events like the Olympic Games, the FIFA World Cup tournament, the NFL Super Bowl, and Boston Marathon must prioritize risks and allocate scarce resources to protect people attending large spectator events. Event hosts and venue owners are faced with the challenge of providing a smooth-running and successful event while keeping event participants and spectators safe and secure from terrorism. Thus, a partnership was formed between NCS<sup>4</sup> and ICT to address these safety and security challenges. </em></strong></p>

  </p>
  <p>In 2017, the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) and the University Southern Mississippi's USA, National Center for Spectator Sports Safety and Security (NCS<sup>4</sup>) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to foster international cooperation
    in education, training, research, and thought leadership in counter-terrorism. Given the respective knowledge of each institution, ICT and NCS<sup>4</sup> are developing a series of educational products about terrorism and counter-terrorism that will
    benefit law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies around the world who are dealing with threats to sports safety and security. The institutions will focus on development of joint training programs and addressing needs of industry and counterterrorism
    and sports safety and security professions.</p>

  <div>ICT and NCS<sup>4</sup> are currently developing a 3.5-day pilot course for senior leaders and managers. The inaugural course is planned for 12-15 July 2018 in Louisville, Kentucky (USA). The course will be taught by subject matter experts in international
    counterterrorism and sport safety and security from ICT and NCS<sup>4</sup>. The course is a scenario-based practicum, teaching participants about terrorism, how terrorism is evolving, the challenges of counterterrorism, and how to mitigate the risks
    posed by terrorism through operations planning and protective measures. This unique course will use a Red Team
  <span class="thov" title="During the National Sports Safety and Security Conference and Exhibition (July 9-12), experts from the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) from Israel, will be leading a Red Team Exercise.

Red Team methodology is a multi-stage process placing the audience in a spectator position and shifting their sights onto the adversary. It provides the audience with a unique vantage point “behind enemy lines”, enabling them to monitor the inner workings of a Jihadi terrorist organization preparing an attack against a sport facility.

The information independently collected from a variety of open sources is then utilized by the Red Team for considering several attack modes out of which one is ﬁnally transformed into an operational plan. Target selection, intelligence evaluation and planning stages are transparent to the audience who can closely observe and monitor them in order to obtain an intimate insight as to how a given terrorist organization functions in terms of its fundamental mind set, ideological and operational considerations, decision making process and the ﬁnal formulation of an Modus Operandi.">[More Info]</span>
