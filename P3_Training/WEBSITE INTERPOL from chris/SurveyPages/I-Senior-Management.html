<p style="font-weight: 400;"><br />This course was first offered at INTERPOL Headquarters in Lyon, France from 12-14 September 2017.  Senior police officials from 27 nations attended the course.  The Sport Security Senior Management Course is a scenario-based practicum of primary areas within the field of sporting event policing and security management:<br /></p>
<ol class="list">
<li>Decision making</li>
<li>Planning process and incident management</li>
<li>Strategic perspective of strategic, tactical, and operational incident management</li>
<li>Crowd and evacuation management</li>
<li>Crisis information management</li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The course prepares senior law enforcement officials to use the decision making process to prepare for and respond to a large-scale incident during a major international sporting event. To reinforce the training objectives, participants will utilize skills and knowledge acquired for simulation-supported, scenario-based exercises addressing emergency response by senior-level law enforcement in support of tactical response activities. These activities are designed to hone both individual and team decision making, multi-agency and national coordination, and senior-level incident management and crisis communication skills in the context of major international sporting event operations.</p>
