<h3>Welcome to the INTERPOL Risk Management Challenges for MAJOR International Sporting Events training course page. </h3>
<p>The <em>Risk Management Challenges for Major International Sporting Events</em> course is a scenario-based practicum, designed by international subject matter experts, to teach senior police officials and incident management team leaders a systematic
  process to analyze and prioritize risks posed by a crisis, crowd management, crowd violence, and terrorism, and develop effective risk treatments for a major international sporting event based on the<span> </span>ISO 31000<span> </span><em>Risk Management </em>process.
  The key learning points are:</p>

  <li><span></span>Applying human rights and policing principles to risk management.</li>
  <li><span></span>Identifying the international, regional, country and local context for risk management.</li>
  <li><span></span>Completing a risk assessment, including risk identification, risk analysis, and risk evaluation.</li>
  <li><span></span>Prioritizing risks and resources.</li>
  <li><span></span>Selecting appropriate risk treatment options for a crisis, crowd management, crowd violence, and terrorism.</li>
  <li><span></span>Establishing strategic, operational and tactical levels of command.</li>
</ul>
<p>The course provides additional content on crowd management, protective measures, crowd violence, counterterrorism, and optimizing resources for emergency response.</p>
<p>The<span> </span><em>Risk Management Challenges for Major International Sporting Events<span> </span></em>course is scenario-based, allowing participants to use the ISO 31000<span> </span><em>Risk Management</em><span> </span>process to explore risk management
  under challenging conditions including a crisis, crowd management, crowd violence, and terrorism. The course is intended to prepare senior law enforcement officials and incident management team leaders to identify, analyze, and evaluate risks, and to
  select appropriate risk treatments during event and emergency operations planning.</p>

</figure>
<p>To reinforce the training objectives, participants will use their experience and skills and knowledge acquired during the course for scenario-based exercises during the course and case studies. These activities are designed to hone both individual and
  team decision making, multi-agency and national coordination, and senior-level crowd safety planning for major international sporting events.</p>
<p>The course addresses risk management challenges for countries that host major international sporting events.  Instructors challenge participants to use a systematic approach to risk management to answer “what if” as they prepare event and emergency operations
  plans for a major international sporting event. </p>
<p>Hosting a major international sporting event brings with it a national responsibility on the part of the host government to safeguard the event and protect the participants and spectators. Internationally sanctioned sporting events require building human
  rights compliant, effective, and sustainable security strategies and plans that can be implemented by strategic, operational, and tactical level leaders and teams.</p>
<p>This course was developed by subject matter experts to teach senior security professionals and incident management team leaders to address risk management in the earliest stages of preparedness as they develop and revise comprehensive security strategies
  and policies utilizing their current national security plans for hosting major international sporting events. In addition, major international sporting events require senior law enforcement officials to take steps to maintain public order, enhance crime
  prevention, and to improve standard national security policies and practices.</p>
<p>The course has 10 modules, which includes a bit of lecture, lots of group activities, table top exercises and a capstone event focused on the International Twenty20 Cricket Finals (see the Course Flow).  We’ve provided a video about cricket in case you
  are unfamiliar with the sport. </p>
