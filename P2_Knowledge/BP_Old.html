<p>The environment and threats surrounding sporting events change, and as a result, guidance on best practices should be considered a <strong>living document</strong> that must change to address emerging challenges, take advantage of new resources, and avoid the development of patterns that could result in a security or safety risk. <strong>Continuous improvement</strong> should be the standard by which each sport organization’s safety and security plans are reviewed and refreshed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to achieve the mission described above, the National Center for Spectator Sports Safety and Security (NCS4) at the University of Southern Mississippi hosts annual summits for Intercollegiate Athletics, Interscholastic Athletics; Commercial Sports and Entertainment Facilities; and Marathons and Running Events.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During these summits, representatives from event management, facilities operations law enforcement, emergency management, fire, emergency medical services, technology firms, and public safety agencies discuss current safety and security issues, identify solutions, and propose future best practices through professional collaboration.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The NCS4 provides open-access (free download) to the resulting best practice guidebooks in order to assist those responsible for safety and security at sporting events. The NCS4 encourages venue and event operators, as well as governing bodies (spot leagues, associations, and federations) to adopt these important practices. If you would like to participate in <a href="/professionaldevportal/events/summits">future summits</a>, please let us know.</p>
