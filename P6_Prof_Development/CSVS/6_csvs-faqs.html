            	1. How is the Certified Sports Venue Staff Certification (CSVS) certification program different from other certification programs?</h2>
    <p>The CSVS program is the nation’s first comprehensive sport and special event security credential for front line venue and event staff. The simple, efficient, and affordable package provides monthly employee background monitoring, baseline staff training,
      and security screening, reporting, and vetting for your staff in one single package. The three components of CSVS are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Online training for front line venue staff</li>
      <li>
        Continuous monthly monitoring of an applicant’s background screening via the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC)</li>
      <li>
        Secure Visitor Screening, also known as GreenLight® (for contractors and 3rd party vendors)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>CSVS is the only certification in the country that blends front line venue staff training with a comprehensive monthly monitored background check using the FBI’s National Criminal Information Center dataset.</p>

            	10. Does the background screening comply with Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines and regulations?</h2>
    <p>Yes. The CSVS is powered by the REDTAIL System, the industry’s only patented screening process that provides for applicant participation in the background screening process by enabling them to review background reports. The use of the REDTAIL System
      results in Accuratized® reports, which ultimately limits liability for employers, decreases manual review or reports, and ensures compliance with FCRA and EEOC requirements.</p>
