    <h1>Certified Sport Security Professional (CSSP)</h1>
    <p>The intent of the CSSP certification program is to establish standardized competencies among individuals holding leadership positions in the sports security industry and to ensure that the most current techniques, strategies and solutions are used
      to mitigate safety and security risks inherent to spectator sport venues.</p>
    <p>The CSSP certification focuses on advancing the sports safety and security industry by addressing the competency requirements of current security professionals and those related professionals in law enforcement, emergency management, government, public
      safety, human resources, and event management, among others. These individuals work at the middle and upper levels of an organization and may be responsible for creating security related policies, procedures, operating plans, creating and delivering
      training, and overseeing the selection of other venue and event personnel and/or event personnel providers (vendors). They serve in a command capacity during events and ensure that event plans are being properly followed and also provide upper level
      supervision of event personnel and/or event personnel providers.</p>
    <p>The CSSP designation is awarded to individuals who meet the education and experience criteria, and who demonstrate the requisite knowledge, skill and ability by successfully completing the CSSP multiple choice examination. Individuals who earn the
      CSSP certification are required to completed ongoing requirements through continuing education and contributions to the profession. For more information about the CSSP certification, please request a copy of the<span> </span><a href="https://forms.usm.edu/ncs4/view.php?id=27604">CSSP Candidate Handbook</a>.</p>
    <p>This certification program was developed with the support of the<span> </span><a href="http://www.homelandsecurity.ms.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Mississippi Office of Homeland Security</a>.</p>

    <h2><span><strong>ANSI Accreditation of CSSP Certification</strong></span></h2>
    <p><span>ANSI is a private non-profit organization that facilitates standardization and conformity assessment activities in the United States. The institute oversees the creation, promulgation, and use of thousands of standards, guidelines, and conformance measures that directly impact businesses and consumers in nearly every industry. ANSI also provides third-party accreditation of organizations that certify that products, processes, personnel, services, systems, and certificate programs meet recognized international standards. The CSSP certification earned accreditation under ANSI’s personnel certification program ISO/IEC 17024:2012.</span></p>

      <div class="open-target">To achieve accreditation, the CSSP program was evaluated on a broad range of activities and CSSP certification policies and procedures needed to demonstrate that:
        <ul>
          <li>The program is open and transparent</li>
          <li>The program is objective, fair, and impartial</li>
          <li>There are appeals procedures for complaints and program disputes</li>
          <li>The program is supported by an organization with sound management systems</li>
          <li>The decision-making body for the certification program is autonomous and without undue influence by special interests</li>
          <li>The certification assessment methods used to evaluate competence are based on valid research methodologies and procedures</li>
          <li>Certification is based on a process that consistently distinguishes those who meet a level of competency and skills as sport security professional from those who do not.</li>
        </ul>
        Attainment of ANSI accreditation grows and protects the integrity of the CSSP certification. Accreditation protects the value of CSSP certification from changes in industry, recognizes the quality of NCS4’s organizational and certification processes,
        more effectively positions CSSP certification for international growth, and elevates the CSSP to the forefront of the sport safety and security profession.</div>
