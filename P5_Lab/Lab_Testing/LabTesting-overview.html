      <label class="dropdown_D" for="content_1"> FAQ's</label>
      <div class="open-target">
        <h3>How long does an evaluation take?</h3>
        <p>The length of an evaluation depends largely on the solution provider. NCS4 works directly with solution providers to define product capabilities and evaluation criteria. Once the scope of work is defined, the evaluation process can begin. The
          entire process takes a minimum of 2 months and take much longer if required. In short, the process is designed to allow solution providers to move at a pace that is comfortable for them.</p>
        <h3>Are evaluations comparative?</h3>
        <p>Evaluations are non-comparative and unbiased. Every evaluation is customized to the product and tested in an operational environment. Additionally, industry and technical experts are carefully selected to ensure a fair and high-quality process.</p>
        <h3>What if I fail the evaluation?</h3>
        <p>An evaluation is not designed to be a pass or fail process. The goal of the process is to validate a products ability to enhance sports safety and security operations. The process allows for products and processes to be refined prior to evaluation.
          Following the evaluation, practitioners can review the report to determine if the solution is right for their safety and security programs.</p>
        <h3>How much does a product evaluation cost?</h3>
        <p>While costs are typically between $15k - $20k, the cost of an evaluation will vary based on location, industry expertise requirements, duration, and facility requirements.</p>
